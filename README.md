# pca
This repo is a structured introduction and application of Principal Component Analysis.
The idea behind this repo is to move from a high level overview of using PCA from the sklearn library to understand the concept, then implement it from scratch using only numpy and test, benchmark it on synthetic stock market data.
The next step was to understand use cases of PCA for applications such as image compression and reconstruction, followed by portfolio construction.

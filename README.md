# pca
This repo is a structured introduction and application of Principal Component Analysis.
The idea behind this repo is to move from a high level overview of using PCA from the sklearn library to understand the concept, then implement it from scratch using only numpy and test, benchmark it on synthetic stock market data.
The next step is to understand use cases of PCA for applications such as image compression and reconstruction.
Finally I plan to implement a PCA model on huge open source datasets using incremental PCA and parallel processing.
